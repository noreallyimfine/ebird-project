# ebird-project
Analyze eBird bird sighting data to track migration patterns and build model to determine rareness of given bird sightings.


### Bird Migration
To read the blog post I wrote on this part of the project and some visualizations I made for it, go [here](https://medium.com/@avraham.jacobsohn/us-bird-migration-11e7e96cf2b5).

If you want to dive into the code, check out the `/migration_analysis` folder. I've condensed everything down to 1 Jupyter Notebook.


### Predictive Model
For the predictive model, I labelled bird sightings in my training set as either [**'Common'**, **'Uncommon'**, or **'Rare'**] based on the percentage of all bird sightings in their region during that season they represented. Then I trained some models to predict off new bird sightings.
