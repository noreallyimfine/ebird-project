# Is this bird rare?
Analyze eBird data and draw insights. Build model to classify bird sightings as by rarity ('Common', 'Uncommon', 'Rare')


### Data

Data drawn from [eBird by Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://ebird.org/data/download)


### Purpose

* Fun to look at bird data
* Keep my pipeline skills fresh
* Learn PySpark
* Deploy a nice end product


### Stage 1

Before diving in to PySpark and working with the entire dataset, I wanted to get comfortable with the data itself and get a sense of how I wanted to approach this project.
