Feature engineering to be done:
    - columns used:
        - COMMON NAME
        - COUNTRY
        - STATE
        - COUNTY
        - LATITUDE
        - LONGITUDE
        - OBSERVATION DATE
    - convert OBSERVATION DATE to Datetime
    - extract year, month from OBSERVATION DATE
    - new column Season mapped from month (should I use month/day for more accurate?)
    - new column Region from map dataset
    - new column LocationRare from percent of total observations 
    - new column SeasonRare from percent of total that bird observations by season


WORK DONE SO FAR
        - read in part of massive file to df
        - explore data
            - bird count ~= 1800
            - country count == 116
        - split off 5 birds to analyze separately for easier visualizing
        - create crosstabs and pivot tables to understand data
        - plot lat/lon points to see spread
        - determine threshold for 'Rare' (currently <0.15)
        - add inital label, based on seasonal raredness
        

STEPS TOWARDS MODELING
        - create labels using excel sheet of the map
        - df with bird name, lat, lon, season, and label
        - 3 labelling columns (location-rare, season-rare, final rare)
        - location rare will be if this bird appears in <15% of all sightings
        - season rare is when <15% of that birds sightings in that location appear in that season
        - for season rare I will need the polygon groupings
        - will start with only US to narrow down, make it easier
        - 
        
STILL TO FIGURE OUT
        - plot points with different colors for different seasons
        - plot points with rare and common colored separately
        - apply all feature engineering steps to full dataset
        - can i make a regression line plot of a single bird to determine a path of migration?
        - maybe use total observed birds instead of a count of observation instances
